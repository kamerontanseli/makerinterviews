## Tell me a little bit about yourself?

I've been a developer for over 4 years now. Started at 15 at an agency in St Albans and was working with Python, Django, and Backbone.js to build a CMS.

After that, I moved to London where my tech career flourished. I started at a company called Motivii as the lead front end. it was an HR tech pulse survey company. That lasted for a year before the company shut down (very sad about that).

Moving on from defeat I joined a fast-growing startup called Flux, a digital receipts company. After not a very good job spec fit I left 10 months later to make products for 2 months and then do remote work full-time.

In my time off I decided to pursue [zinc.vc](https://zinc.vc/) (didn't get in, unfortunately), [Salud](https://trysalud.com/) (allergy app) and this very site you're reading ðŸ˜„.

## What is the book (or books) youâ€™ve recommended most, and why? Or what are the one to three books that have greatly influenced your life?

**4 Hour Work Week by Tim Ferriss**

It's a purposely cliche title but trust me it's amazing. This book sparked the inner self-tracking nerd inside of me. It got my friend to quit his job and pursue screenplay writing and surfing. It has filled me with so much determination that I keep by my bedside 24/7.

**Traction by Gabriel Weinberg**

It's a real eye-opener. I used to think the only way to market my products was through ProductHunt or social media. Traction helped me learn about [Quant Based Marketing](https://okdork.com/quant-based-marketing-for-pre-launch-start-ups/) and that allowed me to do some pretty deep research on the allergy & maker industries.

The key lesson from the book is to try what everybody won't do and to spend 50% on development and 50% on marketing.

**Zorba the Greek by Nikos Kazantzakis**

I picked this up after a recommendation from the previous CEO. At the time I was learning about Epicurian philosophy and its differences to Stoicism. Zorba created a feeling within that urged me to create a life where I could be by the sea, have meals with friends and work on things I care about.

## What products have most inspired you to create more, and what is it about those products that make you feel that way?

**Quirk (**[**https://quirk.fyi**](https://quirk.fyi/)**)**

I really love it when makers create products that help improve people. Quirk is one of those products. I suffer from anxiety a lot of the time, I guess a lot of other maker's do as well. Quirk is one of those apps that helps you realize that a lot of our thoughts our common and are easy to overcome.

**Tide (**[**https://tide.moreless.io/en/**](https://tide.moreless.io/en/)**)**

Tide is a meditation app that uses natural sounds to help you focus, sleep and meditate. I picked it up after not really liking Headspace (the voices are annoying) and what struck me was just how beautifully designed everything was, from the sounds recorded to the application UI. 

Everything was built to be as relaxing as possible.

**WorkFlowly (**[**https://workflowy.com**](https://workflowy.com/)**)**

WorkFlowly is a note-taking app but with a twist, everything is a bullet point and every bullet point can be another nested page. After trying 25+ note apps I stuck with WorkFlowly because it reflected the way I think. In concise organized bullet points.

**Lifesum (**[**https://lifesum.com**](https://lifesum.com/)**)**

I would not be as healthy as I am today without Lifesum. Not only did it help me lose 10kg but it also helped me spark a passion for fitness and self-help. You probably think you're healthy now but when you actually start tracking numbers you'll realize just how off you actually were.

**QObserve (**[**https://qotoqot.com/qbserve/**](https://qotoqot.com/qbserve/)**)**

Imagine if you had a way of discovering the days/hours you were most productive, what you spent most of your time on and what you did that day. That's what QObserve does and it's amazing at it.

## How has a failure or apparent failure, set you up for later success? Do you have a favorite failure of yours?

I tend to always forget about bad times. I don't like to be reminded. But if I had to talk about a time it would probably be when I launched summa-rise.com (now dead). It wanted a way to monetize my book notes and thought it was super hacky of me to walk a stripe paywall in front of it and call it day.

Long behold when launch day comes around. No one pays for it. Ha! That's what I got for not validating a market and working on an audience that would pay for something like that.

## If you could have a gigantic billboard anywhere with anything on it that would get a message out to millions or billions of people. What would you say and why? (Could be a few words, a paragraph or someone elseâ€™s quote: Are there any quotes you think of often or live by?)

It would be painted black with huge white words that read: "What are you doing now that in 3 years will equal your success?". I see a lot of people just waste their time watching reality TV or doing other activities to pass the time. **Time is the most important thing you have**. You can't get it back and you can't get any more of it. So do something worthwhile, take an online course, read a book, workout or reach out to someone who inspired you.

## What is one of the best or most worthwhile investments youâ€™ve ever made? (This can be money, time. energy, etc.)

Reading, hand downs. I have read over twenty books this year alone. Mostly subsidized from my last job (company book benefit). I have learned at least one lesson from every book I've read where that's fiction or non-fiction. 

I don't aim to learn something but usually, as I'm reading I realize something and then I go write it down in my [blog](http://kamerontanseli.github.io/) (Though some books just aren't that good to write full notes on).

## What is an unusual habit or an absurd thing that you love?

Tracking everything. I'm an avid believer in what you can track you can improve. Because of that I track eating, sleeping, productivity, heart rate, weight, etc.

## In the last five years, what new belief, behavior, or habit has most improved your life and work?

Going remote is the future. Working in an office is just bad for the soul:

1. You have to wake up super early to not get in a crowded train
2. You have to **stay in the office until you finish** (except lunch & breaks)
3. If you need people you **have to kill time till they come out of meetings**
4. You have to travel back on crowded trains

By going remote I found that:

1. You don't have to commute back and forth
2. **When your tasks are done, your day is done.**
3. People are all over the world. Send them a message and they will get back to you tomorrow.
4. You can **work from anywhere at any time.**

## What advice would you give to a fellow maker about to start working on their first product? What advice should they ignore?

1. Focus on building something for you. Love it and cherish it because when it starts getting tough you will want a product you actually care about.
2. I would ignore trying to do all the hacky Instagram stuff and just start a blog. Write about your passions and mention your product a few times and you will be golden in 6-7 months ðŸ˜‚.

## When you feel overwhelmed or unfocused, or have lost your focus temporarily, what do you do?

1. I go to the gym (amazing for stress release and thinking) or I grab a coffee and walk. If the burnout is more severe, I usually spend some time at my girlfriends (who is not techy) or I book a holiday.
2. In terms of preventative measures I usually meditate (see Tide in the recommended products).
