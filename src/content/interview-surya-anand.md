## Tell me a little bit about yourself?

I dropped out of high school at 15, just because I couldn't take the pressure and simply I was a disaster at it. Currently, I'm 16 working remotely at [designcode.io](https://designcode.io) as a designer.

## What is the book (or books) you’ve recommended most, and why? Or what are the one to three books that have greatly influenced your life?

Recently I started reading books it helps a lot to improve our focus, and I suggest everyone to start reading actual books. Majority of the books I read are related to design but I, also read books about philosophy. Here are some of my favorite picks.

Less but Better is my favorite book, helps you understand ideas of what can be achieved through great design. Moreover, you can learn about Dieter Rams' process and his principles that are still considered as the foundation of design theory.

Creative Selection this book gives you a very close insight into Apple's design process during the Golden Age of Steve Jobs.

Start With Why simply is an amazing book that inspires readers to make good decisions/actions.

## What products have most inspired you to create more, and what is it about those products that make you feel that way?

I was never inspired by any products, but I have been heavily inspired by two great designers they have inspired me to create, learn, explore and moreover helped me to make decisions that I thought I was incapable of.
[Meng To](https://twitter.com/MengTo) and [Tobias Van Schneider](https://twitter.com/vanschneider) if it wasn't them I would have never got into designing. They are constantly inspiring me to the core and I am simply obsessed, I can't express how much they have inspired me.

Working with Meng To, I'm constantly reminded that I should never stop learning. Even before joining DesignCode I, learned a lot from Meng's courses but I have improved a lot since joining the team, everyone in the team is inspiring and I admire everyone.

## How has a failure or apparent failure, set you up for later success? Do you have a favorite failure of yours?

Well, I'm young I haven't seen much failures in my life so far.

## If you could have a gigantic billboard anywhere with anything on it that would get a message out to millions or billions of people. What would you say and why?

> Less is better — Dieter Rams

## What is one of the best or most worthwhile investments you’ve ever made?

I recently started learning how to code, and now I can better understand what works and what might not this helps a lot while designing and saves a lot of time since I'm able to fix issues seen in the code myself. I would encourage everyone to get started, with coding it's not that you have to master it but to have a knowledge about it.

## What is an unusual habit or an absurd thing that you love?

I used to drink 2 liters of coke every day, since the beginning of April but a few weeks ago I completely stopped as it was causing a lot of problems to my body.

## In the last five years, what new belief, behavior, or habit has most improved your life and work?

I try not to fall into any belief, behavior or habit because my mind doesn't stick to anything. I am in a stage where I simply try to follow whatever my mentors follow thinking that I could be like them although I'm aware of this it's really difficult to let go of this feeling, I believe that I should mature before sticking onto something.

## What advice would you give to a fellow maker about to start working on their first product? What advice should they ignore?

I'm trying to follow these:

1. If your young and getting started in design, try to explore as much as possible before focusing on one thing.
2. Focus on improving your design process and communication

## When you feel overwhelmed or unfocused, or have lost your focus temporarily, what do you do?

I listen to music, especially [Ruelle's](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5tIkXJTex4JY7cv9mmgAZx?si=xdPzPLfFSbeGRIdrwBunLw) or just take some time off from the screen to quickly retain my focus back.
