## What is the book (or books) you’ve recommended most, and why? Or what are the one to three books that have greatly influenced your life?

I actually don’t recommend many books. Most of the startup or founder books I have tried to read have been too focused on building big businesses, hiring staff, and shooting for a unicorn. This isn’t something that I’m looking for so I haven’t been able to relate to them. This is totally fine, there are a lot of great resources out there, and not all of them are going to be for you - so I don’t see the need to force myself to digest advice which is not applicable!

I am about to start [Company of One by Paul Jarvis](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07FQ2PFNN/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) - I think this sounds like it will be more for me.

## How has a failure or apparent failure, set you up for later success? Do you have a favorite failure of yours?

Failure can make you a better entrepreneur, but only if you learn from your mistakes. The best way to do this is by sharing failure. This could be private, with your business partner, or public.

For me, the most effective way of learning from my mistakes has been to share them with the world. This helps me by getting it off my chest, and when I share failure I find so many other people jump in and share theirs too. Founding a company is hard, and community support reminds me that I am not alone in my journey of ups and downs.

Failure is not something we talk about enough as a community of founders, developers, designers, marketers, etc. This creates this false view of the startup world where you only read and hear about the success stories. Almost like Instagram, everything is perfected, and only the end result is seen - rather than the difficult journey to get there.

My biggest failure is with a previous startup, ReleasePage. My co-founder James and I spent 6+ months working on this project, building every feature we could think of, perfecting the UI, and coding for eventualities that were super unlikely. When we launched it was a huge flop. We focused too hard on the product, and what we thought people wanted, instead of building a prototype and validating the idea first.

The way that we are building our current product, [Leave Me Alone](https://leavemealone.app), has been influenced heavily by this failure. [We build completely in the open](https://blog.leavemealone.app/building-in-the-open/), we built a very minimal MVP, and asked people to use it very early on to validate the idea. We continue to build like this; iterating and testing often.

## If you could have a gigantic billboard anywhere with anything on it that would get a message out to millions or billions of people. What would you say and why? 

> Don’t be afraid to fail. Failure is good, it means that you are trying to build something, and if you learn from your mistakes then it will only help to shape you and your products in the future.

## What is one of the best or most worthwhile investments you’ve ever made? (This can be money, time. energy, etc.)

Remote work. 3 years ago James and I left our jobs at UK startups to travel the world and explore our own dreams. The freedom that remote work and the nomad life gives keeps me creative, inspired, focused, and motivated. It is not always easy, and there are challenges to overcome (like finding good wifi), but it was an investment in our happiness that pays off every day.

## What is an unusual habit or an absurd thing that you love?

Scuba diving! I got my certifications in Thailand a couple of years ago and I am totally hooked. I absolutely love being in the water and exploring the underwater world. It’s what I do to relax on days off - if location permits of course. James and I plan to get our divemaster soon.

## In the last five years, what new belief, behavior, or habit has most improved your life and work?

Leaving work at work. I used to find it really difficult to separate work from everything else. This was a problem because I used to get stressed about work; if I was unable to solve a problem I would get angry, and that emotion would carry on into the evening. I have made two changes to solve this. Firstly, when I shut my laptop that means work is over and I don’t think or stress about it. Secondly, if I am getting stressed about a problem I switch to something else or take a break to clear my head.

## What advice would you give to a fellow maker about to start working on their first product? What advice should they ignore?

Just start building something. It doesn’t matter what you build or if a solution already exists, what does matter is that you are doing something rather than nothing and learning from it. Ignore advice from anyone that tells you your idea isn’t unique enough to succeed. 

There are a finite number of ideas, and solving the same problem as someone else in a different way is a valid product and the way many people have built profitable businesses.

## When you feel overwhelmed or unfocused, or have lost your focus temporarily, what do you do?

Take a break away from my laptop and try not to feel guilty about it! I have almost burned out a couple of times, and the best solution to both of these was a week or so completely laptop free.
