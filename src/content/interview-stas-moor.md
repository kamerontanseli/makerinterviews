## Tell me a little bit about yourself?

Stas Moor is the maker of an app called [Klokki](https://klokki.com/?ref=makerinterview.club), which enables freelancers to track their time automagically. Visit [stasmoor.com](https://stasmoor.com/?ref=makerinterview.club) to find out more or follow him on Twitter.

## What is the book (or books) you’ve recommended most, and why? Or what are the one to three books that have greatly influenced your life?

There are no books that, for me, stood out by a lot. I believe that everything we read serves as a trigger to think further and make up our minds about it. Therefore, read anything that seems to be interesting to you and if it turns out to be not the case, stop reading it and move on. But I will still highlight one book, which is quite famous — [“The Power of Habit” by Charles Duhigg](https://www.amazon.com/Power-Habit-What-Life-Business/dp/081298160X).


## What products have most inspired you to create more, and what is it about those products that make you feel that way?

The macOS and iOS environments in themselves were always inspiring. The launch of the iPhone was the trigger for me to start making apps, and I couldn’t stop since then. So back in 2010, the first three apps I released, helped me get my first job as a designer. So Apple had a big impact on my life and I still love what they are doing (even though a lot can be improved).

But I want to highlight some apps that I am enjoying now:
* [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) — I recently switched over from Sketch and loved it since.
* [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) — couldn’t live without it.
* [Dato](https://sindresorhus.com/dato) by Sindre Sorhus — very handy little calendar tool.

## How has a failure or apparent failure, set you up for later success? Do you have a favorite failure of yours?

I never looked at failures as such, because they only mean that you learned something which you didn’t know before and therefore made a “mistake”. That is really cheesy, but who cares — we shouldn’t worry about our failures and just keep going.

## If you could have a gigantic billboard anywhere with anything on it that would get a message out to millions or billions of people. What would you say and why?

It would be a white billboard with a black text in the middle of it, that says — _“CARE.”_
It’s something I am trying to live myself by and encourage others to do the same. If we would care more about others and what we do, say, deliver, produce, we would have a much better world around us.

## What is one of the best or most worthwhile investments you’ve ever made? 

I guess there are two events in my life in which I invested time that “gave” me something in return. The first being, when I was starting as a designer, I’ve spent a lot of time pushing myself to deliver better results and learn how to produce work I could be proud of. And the second investment in obviously [Klokki](https://klokki.com/?ref=makerinterview.club) — I am certain that it has a bright future and can serve many people very well.

But my biggest “investment” has to be my marriage because without my wife I wouldn’t be where I am today. Such a commitment to another person teaches you many things and can break you or make you stronger.

## What advice would you give to a fellow maker about to start working on their first product? What advice should they ignore?

Don’t fall for the hype around starting a “business” — be smart about it, because it’s not going to be easy. 

If you are starting out, then save some money first so you have the “freedom” to not worry about money for a while. Or get a freelance gig to cover the basic expenses and work on your venture on aside. And when it comes down to making something, then try solving your own problem first. That way you can relate to it a lot more and therefore have an “advantage” in solving it.

## When you feel overwhelmed or unfocused, or have lost your focus temporarily, what do you do?

Usually, that could mean two things — either I am not interested in the current task or I just need a break from all the digital things. So if it’s the first one, then it’s good to evaluate if what I am doing is worth doing, maybe the task is not important enough yet and therefore can be put back. Work on something that will bring the most value, that will motivate you. And if I just need a break, then I am trying to not beat myself up and just take the break and do something completely different — take a walk, watch a movie, goof around. :)

Don’t forget to live and enjoy all the little moments in life. Be grateful for what you already have, especially the people around you. And care. ;)
