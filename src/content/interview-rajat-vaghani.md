## Tell me a little bit about yourself?

I'm a full time Senior Developer at a startup during the day and a full time developer for my own side projects literally rest of the time. I've been building products since more than 10 years now. My current obsession is [Snap Search](http://snapsearch.online/android) , my effort in promoting a safe and secure method for users to search the web.

## What is the book (or books) you’ve recommended most, and why? Or what are the one to three books that have greatly influenced your life?
Honestly, I used to read a lot of books a couple of years ago and really enjoyed it then. Unfortunately, I lost that habit and haven’t been able to devote time to something I feel is one of the best habits one can have. That being said, a couple of standout books  I do remember reading and being moved by, are:

**‘Steve Jobs’ by Walter Isaacson**

There is a lot to learn from the life of a man that changed the world.

**‘A Thousand Splendid Suns’ by Khaled Hosseini**

A very moving tale, changed my outlook towards life.

**‘To Kill a Mockingbird’ by Harper Lee:** 

A classic! Just really good literature and an amazing story.

## What products have most inspired you to create more, and what is it about those products that make you feel that way? 

The product that inspired me to create my own products would be Cloudica. Unfortunately that stopped just 4-5 months after being launched but I remember it being revolutionary for it’s time. 

I’m talking about 2008 or 2009 I guess. I had just gotten into web development back then (just one out of the many skills I know now) and the tools I used were very limited with the freedom they would offer to developers. Drag & drop things, select colours from the ones they have etc etc. Stuff like wix.com or webs.com. Cloudi.ca (yes, they got that domain too) was stunning. 

It was kind of like Twitter but **had mind-blowing UI and handmade from scratch**. I knew I wanted to make something of my own that day. 

## How has a failure or apparent failure, set you up for later success? Do you have a favourite failure of yours? 

Oh yeah, many times. When I got into Android development, I was making things fast. Within 6 months I had ~10 apps/ games on the play store. What I was doing wrong though, because of which they kind of failed (not many users and negligible revenue) was **I wasn’t giving them individual attention or any marketing push at all**. I learnt from that - and 2 months ago **3 of my apps were acquired by a company for a good amount.**

## If you could have a gigantic billboard anywhere with anything on it that would get a message out to millions or billions of people. What would you say and why?

> “Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, you’ll land among the stars” - Norman Vincent Peale

## What is one of the best or most worthwhile investments you’ve ever made? 

It would have to be my current project - [Snap Search](http://snapsearch.online/android). The kind of recognition and appreciation I am getting for that is really overwhelming. Also, it was an incredible learning experience.

## What is an unusual habit or an absurd thing that you love? 

I don’t think it’s unusual or absurd, but I love working at night. I instantly lose track of time and work till I’m satisfied or just can’t type anymore. I really do wish I would get more sleep.

## In the last five years, what new belief, behaviour, or habit has most improved your life and work? 

The simplest thought - **if you want to be successful, you have to put in effort**. Nobody is going to give you success, fame, or money for no hard work at all. **Nobody owes you that, and you don’t deserve that until you prove it.** 

## What advice would you give to a fellow maker about to start working on their first product? What advice should they ignore? 

My advice would be to not give up. It’s cliche but it’s true. Very rarely will you find overnight success. Everyday **there are so many products being launched, it’s not odd if yours gets lost in the crowd**. You have to have patience and **work hard and persevere**.

Also, **ignore any advice that doesn’t align with your gut instinct**. You know your product, its your baby - you know what will work and what won’t. Make unbiased decisions and you’ll end up giving the best advice to yourself for tricky situations. 

## When you feel overwhelmed or unfocused, or have lost your focus temporarily, what do you do?

Good food and something good to watch! I’m a HUGE TV Show and Movies buff. I’m watching something all the time.
